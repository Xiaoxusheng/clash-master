## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.8] - 2026-02-15

### Performance

- **Up to 60x query performance improvement** 🚀
  - Added `hourly_dim_stats` / `hourly_country_stats` pre-aggregation tables, maintained in real-time on write
  - All dimension queries (domain/ip/proxy/rule/device/country) automatically route to hourly pre-aggregated tables for ranges > 6h
  - Timeseries query optimization: `getHourlyStats`, `getTrafficInRange`, `getTrafficTrend`, `getTrafficTrendAggregated` now read directly from `hourly_stats` for long-range queries instead of scanning and re-aggregating `minute_stats`
  - 7-day range queries reduced from ~10,080 rows scanned to ~168 rows
  - Per WebSocket broadcast total row scans reduced from ~20,160 to ~336
- **`resolveFactTableSplit` hybrid query strategy**: Long-range queries split into hourly (completed hours) + minute (current hour tail) for both performance and precision

### Added

- **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪
  - Introduced Vitest framework with unit tests for `traffic-writer`, `auth.service`, and `stats.service`
  - Added test helpers (`helpers.ts`)
  - Added ESLint configuration and `.env.example`
- **Time Range Picker Enhancements**
  - Added "1 hour" quick preset, replacing the default 30-minute view
  - Added "Today" quick option for trend charts (midnight to current time)
  - Moved 30-minute preset to debug short presets list
- **`BatchBuffer` module**: Standalone batch buffering module, decoupled from collector

### Fixed

- **Cookie authentication security**: Changed `secure` flag from `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to `request.protocol === 'https'`, fixing login loop on HTTP intranet environments where cookies could not be set
- **Windows emoji flag display**: Added `emoji-flag-font` CSS class to proxy-related components (list, chart, grid, interactive stats, rule stats) to fix broken flag emoji rendering on Windows

### Refactored

- **Global AuthGuard refactoring**: Extracted authentication logic from dashboard layout into a standalone `AuthGuard` component, simplified `auth.tsx` and `auth-queries.ts`
- **Collector service decomposition**: Significantly slimmed down `collector.ts` and `surge-collector.ts` by extracting `BatchBuffer` and `RealtimeStore` modules
- Removed legacy `api.ts` entry file, unified to modular controllers

### Technical Details

- `hourly_dim_stats` schema: `(backend_id, hour, dimension, dim_key, upload, download, connections)`, updated in real-time via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
- `resolveFactTable` / `resolveFactTableSplit` methods implemented in `BaseRepository`, shared across all repositories
- Timeseries query thresholds: `getTrafficInRange`/`getTrafficTrend` switch to `hourly_stats` at > 6h; `getTrafficTrendAggregated` switches when `bucketMinutes >= 60`
- Seamless upgrade: new tables auto-created via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, existing `minute_dim_stats` data backfilled to hourly tables on first startup

## [1.2.7] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Surge Backend Support** 🚀
  - Full support for Surge HTTP REST API data collection
  - Complete rule chain visualization (Rule Chain Flow)
  - Full feature support including proxy distribution charts and domain statistics
  - Intelligent policy cache system with background sync
  - Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed API requests

  - RULE LIST cards support container queries for adaptive layout switching
  - TOP DOMAINS cards expand to full width in single-column layout with more data items
- **UX Improvements**
  - Added skeleton loading screen for Backends list in Settings dialog

### Fixed

- **Surge collector short-lived connection traffic loss**: Fixed issue where traffic deltas for completed connections (status=Complete) were not being counted; uses `recentlyCompleted` Map to record final traffic and correctly calculate differences
- **Cleanup timer determinism**: Changed `recentlyCompleted` cleanup from `setInterval` to deterministic triggering tied to the polling cycle
- Fixed IPv6 validation logic using Node.js native `net.isIPv4/isIPv6`

### Refactored

- **Database Repository Pattern Refactoring** 🏗️
  - Split the 5400+ line monolithic `db.ts` into 14 independent Repository files
  - Added `database/repositories/` directory with Repository Pattern architecture
  - Slimmed `db.ts` down to ~1000 lines, retaining only DDL, migrations, and one-line delegation methods
  - Extracted Repositories: `base`, `domain`, `ip`, `rule`, `proxy`, `device`, `country`, `timeseries`, `traffic-writer`, `config`, `backend`, `auth`, `surge`
  - `BaseRepository` encapsulates 13 shared utility methods including `parseMinuteRange`, `expandShortChainsForRules`, etc.
- **Code cleanup** (~140 lines removed)
  - Removed unused `parseRule` function, duplicate `buildGatewayHeaders`/`getGatewayBaseUrl`
  - Cleaned up debug `console.log` statements, unused `sleep()`, `DailyStats` import
  - Removed unused `EXTENDED_RETENTION`/`MINIMAL_RETENTION` constants

### Technical Details

- Surge collector uses `/v1/policy_groups/select` endpoint for policy group details
- `BackendRepository` now includes `type: 'clash' | 'surge'` field across create, query, and update flows
- Cleaned up debug code in `/api/gateway/proxies`
